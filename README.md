This repo contains a python notebook with useful graphs, plots and some pandas tricks for visualizing data.

These examples might come very handy and can save you some time when you are about to plot some data.

Just change the numbers, labeling and title for your case and you got it :)<br>
*Pay attention you will need some .csv files from [all-you-need-is-graph](https://github.com/yotammarton/all-you-need-is-graph) repository to run this notebook yourself.<br>
*Best viewed with Google Colab
